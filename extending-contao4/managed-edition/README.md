# Contao 4 â€“ Managed Edition

> #### warning:: Warning
> This chapter is documenting an upcoming feature of Contao which
> is not released yet.

Starting with version 4.3.4, Contao is available as a so-called
*Managed Edition*. Compared to a regular Symfony application, a 
*Managed Edition* is limited in its customization possibilities to 
allow automatic management by third-party bundles.


## Differences to Contao Standard Edition


### AppKernel

Contao *Managed Edition* does not feature an `AppKernel` class that can be
customized. Bundles are automatically loaded by *Plugins* so users do not need
to know how to write PHP code or what classes to instantiate in what order.


### Config files

In a Contao *Managed Edition*, the configuration is loaded by plugins
and not by application configuration files. This will allow the
application to work without manually adjusting files.


### Console

A Symfony application usually contains a console script in `bin/console`.
In Contao *Managed Edition* the console is part of the
`contao/manager-bundle` and installed in `vendor/bin/contao-console`.

> #### info:: Hint
> If you are an experienced Symfony developer and missing the default
> location of the console at `bin/console`, just add a symlink for
> your convenience: `ln -s ./../vendor/bin/console ./bin/console`.

### Autoloading Contao 3 extensions

Similar to the behavior in Contao 3, the Contao 4 *Managed Edition*
will automatically load all extensions in `system/modules`. The
implementation is designed to work as in Contao 3, so the `autoload.ini`
is taken into account, and an extension can be disabled by placing a
`.skip` file into the extension folder.


## Customizing the application

The Contao *Managed Edition* is not a standard Symfony application,
so you cannot simply edit the config files. In addition to loading 
configuration from packages installed by Composer, you can customize
an installation in several ways.


### Adding a config file

There are two configuration files available in Contao *Managed Edition*:

1. `app/config/parameters.yml` contains parameters like database
    credentials. The file is created and updated by the install tool.

2. `app/config/config.yml` can be created manually to adjust the
    Symfony configuration. This config file is loaded after all plugins.


### Adding resources

The `app/Resources` directory behaves exactly like in a Symfony standard
application, meaning you can override Twig templates etc. If you want
to override Contao resources like DCA files, you can simply add them
to `app/Resources/contao` and they will be loaded at runtime.


### Adding an AppBundle

As [recommended by Symfony][AppBundle], the AppBundle should be your main 
bundle if you need to customize the application. So all application specific
source code should be placed in `src/AppBundle`. For your convenience, the
`AppBundle` class is automatically loaded in Contao *Managed Edition* if
it can be found.


### Adding a Manager Plugin

Each application can have one global class `ContaoManagerPlugin` which
will be automatically loaded if it exists. We recommend this to be
located in your `app` folder, but that does not really matter as long
as the Composer class loader can find it. That means you have to add
it to the `autoload` section of your `composer.json`. If you follow 
the conventions, it should look something like this:

```json
    "autoload": {
        "classmap": [
            "app/ContaoManagerPlugin.php"
        ],
        "psr-0": {
            "": "src"
        }
    },
```

By using a custom plugin you can adjust all features of the application
in the same way any Composer package can do. The `ContaoManagerPlugin`
will be loaded last, so you can always override any existing setup for
your application.
See the other chapters to learn more about how you can use the plugin
to instruct the *Managed Edition* on what it is supposed to do.
