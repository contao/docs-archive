# createNewUser


The `createNewUser` hook is triggered when a new front end user registers on the website. It passes the ID of the new user and the data array as arguments and does not expect a return value. It is available from version 2.2.0.


## Parameters 

1. *int* `$intId`

	Unique ID of the user

2. *array* `$arrData`

	All values which have been submitted on the registration form. Be aware that the user ID is not contained in this array (`$arrData['id']` is empty).


## Example 

```php
<?php

// config.php
$GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS']['createNewUser'][] = array('MyClass', 'myCreateNewUser');

// MyClass.php
public function myCreateNewUser($intId, $arrData)
{
    // Do something
}
```
