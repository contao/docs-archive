# Managing content

The following chapters explain how to manage content in Contao. The Contao core
supports many different content types like articles, news, events, newsletters
or forms. Further content types like banners, tickets, products or
recommendations are available in the [Extension Repository][1]. To create
content, log into the back end and choose one of the modules in the Content
section of the navigation menu.
