# Administration area

To access the Contao administration area (back end) simply add `/contao` to the
URL of your Contao website.

> **Note** The back end login is protected against brute force attacks, so if
you enter a wrong password more than three times in a row, your account will be
locked for 5 minutes. Please note that usernames and passwords are case-sensitive.
