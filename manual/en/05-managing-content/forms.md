## Forms

The built-in form generator can be used to create interactive forms that are
sent via e-mail or stored in the Contao database. Uploaded files can be sent as
e-mail attachment or stored in the Contao files directory. The form generator
supports four different data formats:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Format</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Raw data</td>
  <td>The form data will be sent as plain text message with each field in a new
      line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>XML file</td>
  <td>The form data will be attached to the e-mail as an XML file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>CSV file</td>
  <td>The form data will be attached to the e-mail as a CSV file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>E-mail</td>
  <td>Ignores all fields except email, subject, message and cc (carbon copy) and
      sends the form data like it had been sent from a mail client. File uploads
      are allowed.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Form fields

Similar to content elements, Contao provides a separate element for each type of
form field like text fields, password fields, select menus, file uploads, hidden
fields or submit buttons. Here is an overview of the Contao core form fields:

</table>


### Front end module

The front end module is used to display forms on the website. They can be
configured with the "Modules" module in the back end and have to be added to an
article or page layout to actually show up on the website. The form generator
extension includes one front end module:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Module</th>
  <th>CSS class</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Form</td>
  <td>mod_form</td>
  <td>Adds a form to a page.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Content element

The content element is used to display forms on the website. They can be
configured with the "Form" content element in the back end and have to be
added to an article to actually show up on the website. The form generator
extension includes one content element:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Content element</th>
  <th>CSS class</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Form</td>
  <td>ce_form</td>
  <td>Includes a form.</td>
</tr>
</table>
