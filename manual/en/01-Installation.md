# Installation

The following chapters explain how to install and update Contao. You will learn
how to use the Contao install tool, how to synchronize an existing installation
via FTP, how to set up the Safe Mode Hack and how to configure a live server for
Contao.


## Installing Contao

First of all, download the [latest Contao archive][1] and extract it on your
local computer. Move the files into the `htdocs` folder of your local
installation (e.g. XAMPP) or upload them to your server with an FTP program (we
recommend using [WinSCP][2]). Depending on your server configuration, the public
folder is most likely called `htdocs`, `httpdocs`, `html` or `public_html`.

If you have SSH access, you can download and extract the archive with the
following commands:

``` {.bash}
curl -L http://download.contao.org | tar -xzp
```


### The Contao install tool

To open the Contao install tool, simply add `/contao/install.php` to the URL of
your Contao installation. Note that the install tool is protected against brute
force attacks and will be locked if a wrong password has been entered three
times in a row. To remove the lock, open file `system/config/localconfig.php` in
a text editor, find the following line and set it to `0`.

``` {.php}
$GLOBALS['TL_CONFIG']['installCount'] = 0; // This will remove the automatic lock
```


#### Connecting to the database

Log into your server administration panel (e.g. "Plesk" or "cPanel") and create
a new database for Contao. Then enter the login credentials in the Contao
install tool. Note that the Contao default character set `UTF-8` is written as
`UTF8` in MySQL!


#### Updating the database tables

Once you are connected to the database, Contao automatically checks its tables
and displays a list of recommended changes in case they are not up to date. Make
sure to read those recommendations carefully, because Contao only knows its own
tables and will try to remove those of other applications eventually sharing the
database. Confirm the changes and click the "Update database" button.


#### Importing a template

A template is a predetermined website with an exemplary
page structure and different style-sheets to format the Contao
core modules and content elements.

Since version 3.2.11, the sample web-page is no longer included in the download package.
Depending on the version used, the new [*Contao Official Demo*][12] 
or the old [*Music Academy*][13] can be installed as an extension.
Information on compatibility is available in the extension repository.

**How to install the demo:**

1. Create a new Contao installation with admin account
2. Log in as admin to the back end
3. Install the matching extension [using the extension repository][14]
4. Log out of the back end
5. Open the install tool again

To import a template, select the entry from the drop-down menu
and click the "Import template" button.

**When importing a template, existing data will be replaced!**


#### Creating an admin user

If you did not import a template, you have to create an admin user to log into
the Contao back end. After you have created the account, the installation
process is completed. The link in the lower right corner will take you to the
administration area. If you have imported the example website, you can login as
user "k.jones" with the password "kevinjones".


### Installing the Contao Demo

See *How to install the demo* in the section *Importing a template* above.


### Using search engine friendly URLs

If you are running an Apache server and are allowed to use mod_rewrite, you can
make Contao generate search engine friendly URLs that look like static HTML
documents. A set of default rewrite rules is stored in the `.htaccess.default`
file in the Contao directory. Rename this file to `.htaccess` so the Apache
server can handle it and then log into the back end and navigate to the system
settings. Select "Rewrite URLs" in the "Front end configuration" section and
save your changes. Now Contao generates static URLs like `home.html` instead of
`index.php?id=12`.


## Using the Safe Mode Hack

While trying to install Contao with the install tool, you might have seen a
warning that the local configuration file is not writable.

![](images/localconfig-not-writable.jpg?raw=true)


### File permission issues

The term "Safe Mode Hack" is actually misleading, because it implies that the
problem was caused by the PHP `safe_mode`. However, it is caused by insufficient
file permissions and can occur even if `safe_mode` is disabled, so it should be
called "File Permission Hack" instead. PHP as an Apache module is typically run
as `wwwrun`, `www-data` or `nobody`, whereas the files that you upload via FTP
belong to you (e.g. `web4` or `ab5678`). The server therefore denies the PHP
script Contao access to those files.


#### Using FTP for file operations

To work around the permission problem, Contao establishes an FTP connection to
modify files and folders. All you have to do is to enter your FTP login details.
Take special care when entering the relative path from your FTP root directory
to the Contao folder (e.g. `html/`, `public_html/` or `httpdocs/`).

A few directories still require write permissions, because PHP will access them
directly:

* `assets/images`
* `assets/images/*`
* `system/logs`
* `system/tmp`

The permissions (CHMOD 777) are set by the install tool automatically and do not
have to be adjusted manually normally. Should it be necessary, please **only
adjust the three directories mentioned above** â€“ despite what you might have
read in a tutorial or in the Contao forums!


## Manual update

When it comes to manually updating a Contao installation, you can either upload
the whole Contao download archive to the server (replacing files) or you can
upload only the files that have been modified since the last update
(synchronizing files). Either way, you should always back up the following files
and folders - just in case there is an error or you accidentally override them:

* `files/*`
* `system/config/dcaconfig.php`
* `system/config/initconfig.php`
* `system/config/langconfig.php`
* `system/config/localconfig.php`
* `templates/*`

This will back up your local configuration, your custom templates and your
files.


### Replacing files

Replacing the files of a Contao installation is pretty simple. Just unpack the
Contao download archive on the server or extract it on your local computer and
upload the files with an FTP client. Then restore the files that you have backed
up and remove potential leftovers from earlier Contao versions.

**Attention:** If you have installed any third-party extensions, make sure to
backup and restore them, too, or do not overwrite them at all. Otherwise you
will have to reinstall the modules and depending on the extension you might
eventually lose data!


### Synchronizing files

To synchronize a Contao installation, you can either use the [Unix diff
utility][3] or an FTP program. Unix utilities are typically used by server
administrators only, so they will not be explained here. To synchronize files
via FTP, open WinSCP and connect to the server. Backup the files mentioned above
and then navigate to the Contao directory and click the "Synchronize files"
button.

![](images/synchronization-options.jpg?raw=true)

Review the options carefully and make sure to choose "Preview changes", so you
can check which files will be updated. Then confirm each file in the preview
window and double check the files that are marked for deletion! Click "OK" to
start the synchronization process.

![](images/synchronization-confirmation.jpg?raw=true)


### Updating the database

After you have updated the Contao files, you need to update the database, too.
Fortunately, the Contao install tool will do most of the work for you. Just open
it and enter your password, then scroll down to the database section and confirm
the changes.


### Purge the internal cache

Finally you should also rebuild the internal cache (for DCA and language files). 
In the backend go to "Maintenance" and check "Purge the internal cache" in 
the "Purge data" section. Confirm the action by clicking on "Purge data".

You will now receive a message in the header asking to rebuild the internal 
cache. Click on "Build the cache" to cache the internal files.


## Live Update Service

The Contao Live Update Service is a commercial Contao add-on provided by [iNet
Robots][4], the company of the Contao founder and core developer, Leo Feyer. It
allows you to update your installation with a only few clicks in the back end,
without having to download a Contao archive or using an FTP program to replace
or synchronize files.

[Sign up for a Live Update ID][5]

The Live Update includes the following features:

* Arbitrary up- and downgrades to any Contao version
* Automatic database backup before the update
* Individual validation and completion of the Contao installation
* Comparison of the customized templates and the original files


### Version selection

![](images/live-update-1.jpg?raw=true)


### Template differences

![](images/live-update-2.jpg?raw=true)


### Troubleshooting

99% of all Live Update issues are caused by wrong file permissions. Contao
requires write permissions to manage files and folders, therefore if the Live
Update does not work properly, check your server configuration and make sure to
set up the Safe Mode Hack **as described in this user guide**!


#### How to get support

If you are having problems activating your Live Update ID or receiving the
update archive, please contact the [iNet Robots support][6]. If you are having
problems configuring the Safe Mode Hack or using Contao, please choose a support
option on the [support page][7].


## Moving an installation

Moving a Contao installation from a local server to a live server is not much
different from installing a fresh Contao version, except that you are using the
files from your local installation instead of the Contao download archive and an
SQL dump of your local database.


### Uploading the files

Open your FTP program, connect to the target server and upload all files from
your local Contao installation.


### Exporting the database

The easiest way to create a MySQL dump is to use the database administration
tool "phpMyAdmin". If you are a server administrator, you can also use the
`mysqldump` utility of course. Log into "phpMyAdmin", choose the database that
you want to export and click the "Export" tab in the top menu. It is important
to adjust the export settings according to the screenshot below to minimize
MySQL version compatibility problems.

![](images/sql-export.jpg?raw=true)


### Importing the database

Open "phpMyAdmin" on the target server and create a new database for Contao.
Depending on the server configuration, you probably have to use the server
administration panel (e.g. "Plesk" or "cPanel") to create new databases. Select
the empty database and click the "Import" tab in the top menu. Then upload the
SQL dump of your local database and start the import.

![](images/sql-import.jpg?raw=true)


### Adjusting the database configuration

Finally open the Contao install tool of the new installation (the password
should be the same as for your local installation) and adjust the database
configuration if necessary. Then go to the back end and log in with your
username and password.


## Configuring the live server

This chapter is not about configuring a server in terms of installing Apache or
compiling PHP, which you cannot do on a shared hosting account anyway. It
explains how to check whether the Contao system requirements are met and how to
enable PHP 5.


### Contao system requirements

Contao requires a webserver like Apache or IIS with PHP and MySQL support. The
minimum PHP version is 5.3.2 and the minimum MySQL version is 5.0. 
You also need the PHP extensions "GDlib" (image resizing), "DOM" (XML files),
"SOAP" (Extension Repository) and optionally "mbstring"
(multi-byte character handling) as well as "mcrypt" (data encryption).
Contao has been tested successfully with all major browsers like Firefox
(from version 2) or Internet Explorer (from version 8).


### The Contao check

Download the Contao Check to find out whether your server meets the Contao
system requirements. The script will check whether you can use the Extension
Repository and the Live Update and whether you have to use the Safe Mode Hack or
not. Depending on your system configuration, you can set up a new Contao
installation with the web installer or validate an existing installation.

![](images/contao-check.jpg?raw=true)

Extract the Zip file, upload the `check` folder to your Contao installation
directory and open it in a web browser.

### ISP-specific settings

There are a few major Internet Service Providers that require a little extra
configuration to get Contao to work. Fortunately, they are just the exception
from the rule. The ISP-specific settings are described in the [Contao
forum][10]. If you are looking for hassle-free Contao hosting, check out the
