# Managing content

The following chapters explain how to manage content in Contao. The Contao core
supports many different content types like articles, news, events, newsletters
or forms. Further content types like banners, tickets, products or
recommendations are available in the [Extension Repository][1] or in
[Packagist][2] (See "[Finding extensions or bundles][3]" chapter for more
detailed information). To create content, log into the back end and choose one
of the modules in the Content section of the navigation menu.
