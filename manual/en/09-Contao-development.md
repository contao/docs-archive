# Contao development

The Contao development website, which is the base of the ongoing development of
Contao, is available at [github.com/contao][1]. It e.g. contains a journal of
past changes and future features (milestones) as well as a ticket system to
report issues or request new features. It also supports browsing the Contao code
repository, where you can see exactly which files have changed.


## Creating a new issue

First of all, please note that you have to be logged in to create new tickets.
[Registration on GitHub][2] is free. Then log into your account and click "New
Issue" in the main navigation.

Always describe possible problems in detail and let us know how to reproduce
them in the online demo or in our development environment. If a problem occurs
only in your installation but not in the online demo, please refer to the
[forums][3].
