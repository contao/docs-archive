# prepareFormData

The `prepareFormData` hook is triggered after a form has been submitted, but
before it is processed. It passes the form data array, the form labels array
and the form object as arguments and does not expect a return value. This way
the data can be changed or extended, prior to execution of actions like email
distribution or data storage.

> #### primary:: Available   
> from Contao 3.0.0.


## Parameters

1. *array* `$arrSubmitted`

    The user input from the form.

2. *arrray* `$arrLabels`

    The field labels of the form.

3. *Form* `$objForm`

    The form instance.


## Example Contao 3

<?php

// config.php
$GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS']['prepareFormData'][] = array('MyClass', 'myPrepareFormData');

// MyClass.php
public function myPrepareFormData(&$arrSubmitted, $arrLabels, $objForm)
{
    // this calculates a deadline from a given timestamp
    // and stores it as deadline in $arrSubmitted
