postDownload
------------

The `postDownload` hook is triggered after a file has been downloaded with the download(s) element. It passes the file name as argument and does not expect a return value. It is available from version 2.4.6.


### Example ###

```php
<?php

// config.php
$GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS']['postDownload'][] = array('MyClass', 'myPostDownload');

// MyClass.php
public function myPostDownload($strFile)
{
    // Do something
}
```
