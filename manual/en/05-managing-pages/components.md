## Components

Understanding how pages, articles, content elements and modules relate to each
other is the key to learning Contao. As mentioned before, the site structure is
the central element of your website. Visitors of your website always request
pages and not articles like in a node-based CMS.

The diagram shows that articles and layouts are the two most important page
elements. Whereas articles store the content of a page, the page layout defines
how it is displayed on the website. Contao layouts are CSS-based and of course
do not use layout tables. The following chapters explain how to create style
sheets and modules, how to combine them in a page layout and how to create pages
that are using it.
